# treestride

A new Flutter project.

i have those codes, when the qr code was scanned the data being displayed seems to be the user's data when the qr code was generated/downloaded. so when the data updated or changes and the qr code was scanned again it still displays the old user's data not the updated or latest data, can you help me fix that?
